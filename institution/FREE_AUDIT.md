# Free SIS Security Audit (Limited)

We’re offering a **free security audit** for teams using rule-based or policy-driven systems.

This audit uses **SIS (Security Inspection System)** to statically analyze your rule configurations and identify security risks **before they reach production**.

---

## What You’ll Get

* A static scan of your rule or policy configurations using SIS
* Identified issues with:

  * Severity
  * File / rule location
  * Explanation of risk
* A short, written report (PDF or Markdown)
* Optional follow-up call to discuss findings

**No automated emails. No upsell pressure.**

---

## What We Can Review

Examples include:

* OPA / Rego policies
* AWS IAM policies
* Custom RBAC / ABAC rule files
* Decision tables and authorization configs
* SaaS policy or rules-engine definitions

If it’s **rule-based and security-sensitive**, it’s likely a fit.

---

## What We Don’t Need

* No access to running systems
* No credentials
* No production secrets

All analysis is **static** and can be run on:

* Redacted files
* Sample configurations
* Non-production rule sets

---
