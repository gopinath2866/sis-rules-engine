# SIS – Security Inspection System

> Static analysis for rule engines, policy layers, and business logic configurations.

**SIS** finds security flaws in systems such as:

* OPA / Rego policies
* AWS IAM, Azure RBAC, GCP IAM
* Custom RBAC / ABAC decision tables
* SaaS rule engines and policy configurations

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gopinath2866/sis-rules-engine.git
cd sis-rules-engine
```

## Scan in 30 Seconds

```bash
sis scan -rules ./example-rules/ -target ./your-policy-dir/
```

*Output:* detected violations with severity and file locations.

---

## Why SIS Exists

Rule-based systems are everywhere—but **misconfigured rules** are a frequent cause of
privilege escalation, data leakage, and compliance failures.

SIS adds a **security lens** to your logic layer before those issues reach production.

---

## Get Started

* Quick Start
* Writing Custom Rules
* Example Rule Packs
* **Free Security Audit** (see below)

## When Not to Use SIS

SIS is intentionally scoped. It may **not** be the right tool if:

* Your rule system changes multiple times per hour and is evaluated dynamically at runtime.
* You require **real-time intrusion detection or alerting**.
* You already operate a mature, heavily audited policy-as-code pipeline with equivalent tooling.
* You expect SIS to detect **application logic bugs** in source code (use static analyzers instead).

SIS is designed for **static, pre-deployment analysis** of rule and policy configurations.
## Free Security Audit
We offer a limited number of **free SIS-based security audits** for rule and policy configurations.  
See [FREE_AUDIT.md](./FREE_AUDIT.md) to request one.

# Static Irreversibility Scanner (SIS) v1.0.0

Deterministic pattern scanner for irreversible infrastructure decisions.

## Overview
The Static Irreversibility Scanner (SIS) is a sealed, deterministic artifact that scans infrastructure-as-code manifests for patterns indicating irreversible decisions, identity bindings, or admin override dependencies.

## Features
- **25 Deterministic Rules**: Pattern-based, no inference
- **Stateless API**: JSON in/out, no persistence
- **Multi-Format Support**: Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, Docker Compose, ARM
- **Sealed Logic**: No external dependencies, no telemetry

## Quick Start
```bash
docker build -t sis:v1.0.0 .
docker run -p 8000:8000 sis:v1.0.0
